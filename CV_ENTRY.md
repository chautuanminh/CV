# Pickleball Vision Analytics Project for CV

Here are three headlines/sections to describe this project on your Data Analyst CV:

## 1. Automated Sports Analytics Pipeline with Computer Vision
**Description:**
Designed and implemented an end-to-end computer vision pipeline to extract match statistics from pickleball/tennis video footage. The system integrates deep learning models (YOLOv8, TrackNet) for real-time object detection and tracking of players, the ball, and court boundaries. It features a custom analytics engine that processes raw coordinate data into structured insights, including ball trajectories, speed estimation (km/h), serve detection, and player movement patterns.

## 2. Delivering Actionable Insights from Unstructured Video Data
**Benefit:**
This project demonstrates the ability to transform unstructured video data into high-value, structured datasets for analysis. By automating the extraction of complex metrics like serve counts and ball speed distribution, it eliminates manual tagging, significantly reduces error rates, and enables scalable performance evaluation. The resulting data empowers coaches and players with precise, quantifiable feedback to optimize training strategies and match performance.

## 3. Advanced Data Engineering & Mathematical Modeling Skills
**Skills Demonstrated:**
*   **Mathematical Modeling:** Applied homography matrices and coordinate geometry to map 2D pixel data to real-world 3D metrics, showcasing strong aptitude for spatial analysis and applied mathematics.
*   **Data Transformation**: Engineered robust data pipelines using Python (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`) to clean, filter (rolling averages), and structure raw tracking data for downstream analysis.
*   **End-to-End Problem Solving:** Built a complete analytical solution from the ground up—from data ingestion and model integration to statistical processing and visualization—proving the capability to manage complex data projects independently.
