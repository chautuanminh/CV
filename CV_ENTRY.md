# CV Project Entry: Automated Sports Analytics Pipeline

Here are three headlines/sections to include in your CV for a Data Analyst role, highlighting this project.

## 1. Automated Sports Analytics Pipeline for Pickleball/Tennis
**Project Description:**
Developed a comprehensive computer vision system to analyze pickleball/tennis match footage. The pipeline integrates state-of-the-art models (YOLOv8, TrackNet) for real-time detection and tracking of players, balls, and court boundaries. It features a custom analytics engine that transforms raw video into structured match statistics, including ball trajectories, speed estimation (km/h), and event detection (serves, rallies).

## 2. Extracting Actionable Insights from Unstructured Video Data
**Benefits:**
This project demonstrates the ability to extract high-value, structured data from unstructured video sources, a critical asset for modern data analysis. By automating the collection of match metrics (e.g., serve speeds, player movement), it eliminates manual data entry, reduces error rates, and enables scalable performance analysis. It showcases the capacity to turn raw data into meaningful insights that drive decision-making (e.g., coaching strategies).

## 3. Advanced Data Engineering & Mathematical Modeling Skills
**Relevant Skills for Data Analyst:**
*   **Data Transformation**: Applied homography matrices and coordinate geometry to map 2D pixel data to real-world 3D metrics, proving strong mathematical aptitude.
*   **Python Data Stack**: Utilized `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scipy` for statistical analysis (smoothing, outlier detection) and `OpenCV`/`PyTorch` for data extraction.
*   **End-to-End Problem Solving**: Built a full lifecycle solution—from data collection and model training to cleaning, processing, and visualization—highlighting the ability to manage complex data projects independently.
